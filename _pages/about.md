My research focuses on combining first-principles knowledge and data-driven methods to optimally control uncertain systems, with applications in energy and agricultural systems. In my research, I use tools from *control theory*, in particular model predictive control (MPC), *optimization*, and *reinforcement learning*. 

I am currently an assistant professor at the Delft Center for Systems and Control, TU Delft. I obtained the Bachelor of Chemical Engineering degree from the University of Delaware in 2017 and the Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022.
